#XNInterface - develop branch
XNInterface is a UI library for XNA (and in future, Monogame + SharpDX)

It uses an XML format to define the interface, with an offline processor to convert the files into binary format for faster loading.

The develop branch is currently a reboot of the project, taking into account previous learnings while considering the cross-platform requirement that now exists. As such if you're looking for a functional version, please take a look at the **master** branch which contains the latest XNA version. (Known to work on Windows and WP7)

Disclaimer: I'm currently busy with university and so there may be no progress at times in this branch. All code currently in this branch is pre-alpha and while you may use it (any extensions are welcome through pull requests), I cannot provide any support.
