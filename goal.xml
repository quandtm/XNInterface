<!--
  Special XNA Platform Note: The XNA loader will remove file extensions from images/fonts, and assume they have already been compiled.
  
	The resources node contains all templates and predefined items like fonts.
	Fonts have a src attribute which defines either the .spritefont file, or whatever is relevant for the platform.
	ALL Resources MUST have a Name attribute that is not whitespace.
	Names are optional for all other nodes.
	
	In this sample, a button should be created with a textured background, and text that says "Button says hello!".
	This is bound to the button using the Template named buttonTemplate. Templates are used at compile time only.
	The Template attribute defines which template to use, and that template replaces all child controls for that control.
	The Template itself defines the child controls.

	The Format attribute in the TextBlock defines a string of literals and variables that is constructed at runtime.
	The following variable options are available:
		CONTENT (string content of the current control)
		PARENTCONTENT (string content of the parent control)
		VALUE (ToString() of float value on current control)
		PARENTVALUE (ToString() of float value on parent control)
	By DEFAULT, Format is set to CONTENT
	The font of the textblock can be defined as a resource, or defined inline
  TextBlock can take a Color attribute with a rgb hexcode (#RRGGBB) value. (ideally would like to also support word colors)
	
	Image controls have a source (src), which defines the Texture to render. 
	Texture can be defined inline (in src) or in a resource.
	Image controls can define a Region in the format "x,y,width,height"
	No Region will result in the entire texture being rendered.

	Width and Height can be absolute (pixels) or relative (percentage), a relative value is defined by the % symbol.
	HAlign can be: left, center, right.
	VAlign can be: top, middle, bottom.

	Rendering order is defined by the order of the controls in the document, so controls defined earlier will be
		rendered below controls specified later, child controls are considered to be part of the parent control for this.
	
	The Button control has logic functionality that the other controls do not have, namely pointer events.

	The StackPanel control allows for vertical or horizontal stacking of controls
		The direction is defined with the Orientation attribute, which can be Vertical or Horizontal.
